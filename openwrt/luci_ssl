1. Get the root CA certificate

Let's get the root CA cert.

openssl s_client -connect ca.private-domain.tld:443 < /dev/null > /tmp/temporary.out
openssl x509 -outform PEM < /tmp/temporary.out > /tmp/ca.private-domain.tld.cert
rm /tmp/temporary.out

Note: Don't forget to remove the temporary file /tmp/temporary.out
2. Install the root CA certificate

Trusted certificates are installed in /etc/ssl/certs. However, it is a good practice to follow the FHS 3 and use /usr/local/share for architecture-independant files.

mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
mv /tmp/ca.private-domain.tld.cert /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
ln -s /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.private-domain.tld.cert /etc/ssl/certs/ca.private-domain.tld.cert
chmod ugo-x /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.private-domain.tld.cert

3. Add the root CA certificate to the system's trust store

The certificate is installed but not yet trusted. You need to provide its hash.

# Generate the hash
HASH="$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in /etc/ssl/certs/ca.private-domain.tld.cert).0"
 
# Display the hash value
echo "$HASH"
 
# Link the hash to the certificate
ln -s "/etc/ssl/certs/ca.private-domain.tld.cert" "/etc/ssl/certs/$HASH"
