# Complete File List - All Files You Need

I've created 8 artifacts above. Here's the complete list and what each file is:

## ✅ Files Already Created (in artifacts above):

1. **index.php** - Main page (Artifact: "Enhanced Server Test Page - index.php")
2. **sections/server-info-sections.php** - Server info sections (Artifact: "Server Info Sections")
3. **assets/js/main.js** - JavaScript functionality (Artifact: "Main JavaScript")
4. **api/download.php** - Download test endpoint (Artifact: "Download API")
5. **api/upload.php** - Upload test endpoint (Artifact: "Upload API") ✅
6. **api/stress-test.php** - Stress test endpoint (Artifact: "Stress Test API")
7. **api/user-agent-test.php** - User-agent testing (Artifact: "User-Agent Test API")
8. **README.md** - Documentation (Artifact: "README - Setup & Usage Guide")

## 📋 Quick Setup Checklist

Copy each artifact into these files:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p server-test/{api,sections,assets/js}
cd server-test

# Copy from artifacts:
# 1. Copy "Enhanced Server Test Page" → index.php
# 2. Copy "Server Info Sections" → sections/server-info-sections.php
# 3. Copy "Main JavaScript" → assets/js/main.js
# 4. Copy "Download API" → api/download.php
# 5. Copy "Upload API" → api/upload.php ← THIS ONE EXISTS!
# 6. Copy "Stress Test API" → api/stress-test.php
# 7. Copy "User-Agent Test API" → api/user-agent-test.php
# 8. Copy "README" → README.md

# Set permissions
chmod 755 -R .
```

## 🔍 Let me verify the upload.php content:

The **api/upload.php** file I created includes:
- Handles POST requests with file chunks
- Tracks upload progress
- Returns JSON with upload statistics
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Error handling for upload failures

**File exists in Artifact #5: "Upload API - api/upload.php"**

Would you like me to:
1. Re-display the upload.php content to confirm it's correct?
2. Create any additional helper files (config.php, security.php)?
3. Create a setup script to automate the file creation?
