# Syntax Rules:
# 	1 to 1 corespondence between key and address
# user@domain		address
#
# 	In this case the user@domain is replaced by address only
# 	if the @domain part is equal to something listed in
# 	mydestination, inet_interfaces or proxy_interfaces
# user			address
#
# 	This last form is a wildcard, and all the addresses in the domain
# 	will be replaced with the one address specified 
# 	*** When this last form is used, the postfix SMTP server will
# 	accept mail for any recipient in domain, regardles if that recipient
# 	exists.
# @domain		address
