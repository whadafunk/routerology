# This map is used by the smtp restriction permit_tls_clientcerts

 To find the fingerprint of a specific certificate file, with a specific digest algorithm, run:

    $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -digest -in certfile.pem

The text to the right of "=" sign is the desired fingerprint. For example:

    $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -in cert.pem
    SHA256 Fingerprint=D4:6A:AB:19:24:...:A6:CB:66:82:C0:8E:9B:EE:29:A8:1A

To extract the public key fingerprint from an X.509 certificate, you need to extract the public key from the certificate and compute the appropriate digest of its DER (ASN.1) encoding. With OpenSSL the "-pubkey" option of the "x509" command extracts the public key always in "PEM" format. We pipe the result to another OpenSSL command that converts the key to DER and then to the "dgst" command to compute the fingerprint.

Example:

    $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -pubkey |
        openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER |
        openssl dgst -sha256 -c
    (stdin)= 64:3f:1f:f6:e5:1e:d4:2a:56:8b:fc:09:1a:61:98:b5:bc:7c:60:58

The Postfix SMTP server and client log the peer (leaf) certificate fingerprint and public key fingerprint when the TLS loglevel is 2 or higher.

Example: client-certificate access table, with sha256 fingerprints:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest = sha256
        smtpd_client_restrictions =
            check_ccert_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
            reject

    /etc/postfix/access:
        # Action folded to next line...
        AF:88:7C:AD:51:95:6F:36:96:...:01:FB:2E:48:CD:AB:49:25:A2:3B
            OK
        85:16:78:FD:73:6E:CE:70:E0:...:5F:0D:3C:C8:6D:C4:2C:24:59:E1
