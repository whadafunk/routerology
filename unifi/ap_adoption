Layer 3 adoption is the process of adopting a UniFi device to a remote or cloud-hosted UniFi Network Application. 


Method-1 SSH:

ssh into the ap -> ssh root@ap_address
default passwords: ui or ubnt
set-inform http://ip-of-host:8080/inform


Method-2 DHCP option 43:




This option leverages your DHCP server to inform your UniFi device of the location of the machine running the Network Application remotely. Those with a UniFi Gateway can easily accomplish this by entering the IP address of the remote Network Application in Option 43 Application Host Address field located in the Network Settings.

For those using a third-party gateway or DHCP server, we recommend consulting your manufacturerâ€™s documentation to learn more.



Method-3 DNS:



You'll need to configure your DNS server to resolve
unifi
to your remote UniFi Network Application.

There are two methods of specifying the machine running the Network Application:

    IP Address: http://ip-address:8080/inform
    Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): http://FQDN:8080/inform


DHCP Option 43 Details:


Code need to be set to 43.
DHCP Option Type needs to be set to Hexadecimal.
Value needs a specific prefix of 01:04. Followed by another : and your controllers ip address in hexadecimal notation.
192.168.100.10 would translate to c0a8640a. In this case you need to enter 01:04:c0:a8:64:0a as your Value.
