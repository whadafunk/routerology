There's a bug in later versions of Gnome, that once you set your titlebar buttons to the left, 
you can't chage it back from Tweaks, and it also start to behave glitchy.

To restore the setting you can use gsettings command like bellow:

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':appmenu,maximize,minimize,close'
