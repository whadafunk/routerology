# Docker Compose File Template With Coments
# If we are using compose.yaml or compose.yml there is no need for the version
# You should use docker-compose config to check the compose file

# The following objects support alternative syntax (list): labels, environment

# If you don't specify any other settings for networking, a list with network names can be enough
    networks:
      - default
      - custom_bridge

# If you want to specify custom ip, alias, priority and link_local_ip then you should use this syntax
#   networks:
#     my_new_network:
#       ipv4_address: 1.2.3.4
#       aliases:
#         -one
#         -who
#         -two
#       priority: 100
# aliases declares alternative hostnames for the service on the network. 
# Other containers on the same network can use either the service name or an alias 
# to connect to one of the service's containers.
#
# Docker Compose default network.
# If we do not define a specific network, compose sets up a single default network that each container will join.
# This default network is given a name based on the project's name which in turn is based on the 
# name of the directory it lives in. 
# The name of the project can be overriden with --project-name runtime directive or with the
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable



# If you're not clear about the difference between ports and expose in compose here's a quick overview:
# Expose ports without publishing them to the host machine - theyâ€™ll only be accessible to linked services.
# Only the internal port can be specified.

      - "3000"
