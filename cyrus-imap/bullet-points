- config directory: log, proc, mailboxes.db, quota
- mailboxes directories: header, index, message files, seen, cache
- cyrus utilities: reconstruct, quota, cyradm, sieveshell -> cyrus-common, cyrus-admin, cyrus-clients
- acl permissions: l (lookup), r(read), s(seen flags), i (insert), p(post), c(create/delete), a(administer)
- negative rights
- mail partitions, news partition, sieve directory
- mail posting (host, sendmail)
- virtual domain
- quota and quota-roots; quotas are expressed in kbytes


How quota works:

Quota roots are specified in the mailboxes file
For each quota root from mailboxes there is a file under the config_directory/quota
that specifies quota usage (in bytes), quota limit (kbytes)

Other supporting programs:

- dohash / rehash / undohash
- ctl_cyrusdb, ctl_deliver, ctl_mboxlist
- ipurge
- mbpath
- squatter (fulltext index)

Logging per user

- Create a directory with the name of the user under /conf_dir/log

VIRTUAL DOMAIN

- when imap receives a username of form user@domain.com, it knows how to parse the user and domain part separatedly
- when saslauthd is used it will send to it user@domain, but saslauthd can handle the domain part also separated
- if you do user@default_domain you can be the cyradm specified unqualified in the config file
