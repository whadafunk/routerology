Cyrus IMAPD


Cyrus IMAPD is a package that contains more than just imap. Actually if you look at the available packages you will see that there are a couple of packages that make up the cyrus imap paradigm. 

cyrus-imapd (imapd and idled for newmail notifications)
cyrus-common (mostly libraries, plus the maintenance tools like reconstruct)
cyrus-admin (cyradm and other utilities to manage the system)
cyrus-clients (testing clients for imap, pop3, smtp, sieve, etc)
â€¦  plus other components.
cyrus-caldav
cyrus-pop3d
cyrus-nntpd


To sum up the important features of the Cyrus IMAP:

IMAP/S Server
Support for sieve scripts creation and management
Security Features (ACL, Quota)
Calendar sync through webdav plugins (Cardav, Caldav)
SASL Authentication
Mailbox management (through various perl scripts)
NetNews

IMAP Namespace

One of the

One of the important things that you need to grasp is the imap namespace, which of course is different from the file system namespace. 
The imap namespace represents the mailboxes and folder names as they are returned as response to imap commands like list.

There are three type of folder that we can subscribe to:

user mailboxes - all user mailboxes are starting with the name user
other user mailboxes 
shared folders

These folders will appear in the imap namespace differently, depending on the some of the settings in imapd.conf

altnamespace:  - this parameter influences how the mailboxes are displayed (not as they are stored)
userprefix
sharedprefix
unixhierarchysep
	

The unixhierarchysep is the most important one from the four, because it allows for user accounts with dot in the name (like joey.starr). It replaces the "." with the "/" as the hierarchy separator.
