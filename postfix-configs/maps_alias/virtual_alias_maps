#This file is processed by the cleanup daemon before queueing the message for delivery
#For each entry match in this list, the envelope only of the message will be replaced with the corresponding key
#The key, can be a multiple value; In this case the entry functions as an email alias group.
#Addresses found in virtual alias maps are subjected to another iteration of virtual aliasing, 
#but are not subjected to canonical mapping, in order to avoid loops. 
#The matching is done in the following order:
# 1. Complete address user.name@domain.com
# 2. Only the username part user.name
# 3. Only the domain part @domain.com
#For keys matching only the domain part, attention is required because all addresses in that particular domain
#that do not have an virtual_alias match will be rewriten; it can be used for a spamtrap
