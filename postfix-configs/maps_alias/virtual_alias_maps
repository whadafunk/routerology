# This file is processed by the cleanup daemon before queueing the message for delivery
# For each entry match in this list, the envelope only of the message will be replaced with the corresponding key
# The key, can be a multiple value; In this case the entry functions as an email alias group.
# Addresses found in virtual alias maps are subjected to another iteration of virtual aliasing, 
# but are not subjected to canonical mapping, in order to avoid loops. 
# The matching is done in the following order:
# 1. Complete address user.name@domain.com
# 2. Only the username part user.name
# 3. Only the domain part @domain.com
# For keys matching only the domain part, attention is required because all addresses in that particular domain
# that do not have an virtual_alias match will be rewriten; it can be used for a spamtrap
# With this form, the  Postfix  SMTP server accepts mail for any recipient in domain, 
# regardless of whether that recipient exists.

# ATTENTION
# When using a lookup key of format user.name without the @domain part, the domain of the recipient address in the envelope, needs to be one of the local hosted domains (mydestination, myorigin, inet_interfaces, proxy_interfaces)
