#  The   optional  transport(5)  table  specifies  a  mapping  from  email
#       addresses to message delivery  transports  and  next-hop  destinations.
#       Message  delivery  transports  such as local or smtp are defined in the
#       master.cf file, and next-hop destinations are typically hosts or domain
#       names. The table is searched by the trivial-rewrite(8) daemon.

#       local_transport (default: local:$myhostname)
#              This is the default for final delivery to  domains  listed  with
#              mydestination,  and  for  [ipaddress]  destinations  that  match
#              $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces. The default nexthop  des-
#              tination is the MTA hostname.
#
#       virtual_transport (default: virtual:)
#              This  is  the  default for final delivery to domains listed with
#              virtual_mailbox_domains. The default nexthop destination is  the
#              recipient domain.
#
#       relay_transport (default: relay:)
#              This  is  the default for remote delivery to domains listed with
#              relay_domains. In order of decreasing  precedence,  the  nexthop
#              destination   is   taken   from  relay_transport,  sender_depen-
#              dent_relayhost_maps, relayhost, or from the recipient domain.
#
#       default_transport (default: smtp:)
#              This is the default for remote delivery to  other  destinations.
#              In  order  of  decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is
#              taken       from        sender_dependent_default_transport_maps,
#              default_transport,  sender_dependent_relayhost_maps,  relayhost,
#              or from the recipient domain.

#TABLE SEARCH ORDER
#       With  lookups  from  indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#       tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried  in  the  order  as
#       listed below:
#
#       user+extension@domain transport:nexthop
#              Deliver mail for user+extension@domain through transport to nex-
#              thop.
#
#       user@domain transport:nexthop
#              Deliver mail for user@domain through transport to nexthop.
#
#       domain transport:nexthop
#              Deliver mail for domain through transport to nexthop.
#
#       .domain transport:nexthop
#              Deliver mail for any subdomain of domain  through  transport  to
#              nexthop. This applies only when the string transport_maps is not
#              listed  in  the  parent_domain_matches_subdomains  configuration
#              setting.  Otherwise, a domain name matches itself and its subdo-
#              mains.
#
#       * transport:nexthop
#              The special pattern * represents any address (i.e. it  functions
#              as  the  wild-card  pattern,  and is unique to Postfix transport
#              tables).


# A  null transport and null nexthop field means "do not change": use the
#       delivery transport and nexthop information that would be used when  the
#       entire transport table did not exist.
#
#       A non-null transport field with a null nexthop field resets the nexthop
#       information to the recipient domain.
#
#       A null transport field with non-null nexthop field does not modify  the
#       transport information.

# EXAMPLES
# my.domain    :
# .my.domain   :
# *            smtp:outbound-relay.my.domain

# example.com      slow:
# example.com      :[gateway.example.com]
# .example.com     :[gateway.example.com]
# example.com      smtp:bar.example:2025
# example.com      smtp:bar.example, foo.example
# .example.com     error:mail for *.example.com is not deliverable
