Apart from configuration inside main.cf, you also need to take care of the configuration file for the sasl library. 
The way this works is that smtp/smtpd is sending a request to the sasl library with the name of the application/service needing authentication, and the library is using that name to construct a path/filename where to find the name of the configuration file for that particular application/service.

Is this the config file where we specify mechanisms and methods for the SASL authentication:

pwcheck_method: salsauthd, auxprop, pwcheck
auxprop_plugin: sasldb, sql, ldapdb
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 GSSAPI ANONYMOUS OTP
log_level: 1 - 7
sql_engine: mysql, pgsql, sqlite
slq_hostnames: host:[port]
sql_user
sql_passwd
sql_database
sql_select: SELECT UserPassword from email.credentials where AccountName = '%u' and Domain = '%r'
sql_usessl: yes | no
SASL has two small utilities for testing (sample-server and sample-client)
Sample server sends sample as application_name by default, but it can be configured


If you want to use local users with sasldb, then you have a couple of utilities to create and manage users

saslpasswd2 (-c create, -d disable, -f sasldb, -a appname, -u domain)
sasldblistusers2 -f sasldb



### CONFIG FILES PATHS ####


Usualy the config files for sasl library are searched under /etc/sasl2, or /usr/local/lib/sasl2
The name of the config file is sent by the process that is calling the library.
In case of postfix for example there are a couple of settings related to path finding:


- smtpd_sasl_path
Implementation-specific information that the Postfix SMTP client passes through to the SASL plug-in implementation that is selected with smtp_sasl_type. 
Typically this specifies the name of a configuration file or rendezvous point. 

- smtpd_sasl_application_name
The application name that the Postfix SMTP server uses for SASL server initialization. This controls the name of the SASL configuration file. 
The default value is smtpd, corresponding to a SASL configuration file named smtpd.conf.

Search path for Cyrus SASL application configuration files, currently used only to locate the $smtpd_sasl_path.conf file. 
Specify zero or more directories separated by a colon character, or an empty value to use Cyrus SASL's built-in search path. 
- cyrus_sasl_config_path
