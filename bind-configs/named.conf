/* The configuration file for Bind, supports all kinds of comment styles:

# LETS DEFINE FIRST A COUPLE OF ACLS THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE
# THROUGH THIS CONFIGURATION

#=====================================================================================#

acl "office_lan" { 192.168.56.0/24; };
acl "servers_lan" { 192.168.100.0/24; };
acl "known_networks" { "office_lan"; "servers_lan"; };

# IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DEFINED ACLS YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING PREDEFINED ACLS:
# any, localhost, localnets, none

# THE KEY BELOW IS USED BY RNDC TO ISSUE CONTROL COMMANDS,
# AND IT CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED IN A SERVER SECTION. ALSO IN TRANSFER AND UPDATE CLAUSES
# THE KEY CONFIGURATION SECTION CAN BE MOVED IN A DIFFERENT FILE
# AND REFERRED HERE WITH INCLUDE KEYWORD. -> include "rndc_local.key"

#=====================================================================================#

      inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
              allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "named_local"; };
};


#=====================================================================================#

# THE SERVER CONFIGURATION SECTION IS RELATIVE NEW AND IT 
# ALLOWS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS TO BE DEFINED WHEN THIS SERVER IS INTERACTING 
# WITH THE REMOTE SERVER DEFINED BY IP-ADDR

# server 192.168.56.10 {
#	bogus no; ACCEPT INCOMING TRAFFIC FROM REFERRED IP
#	provide-ixfr yes;
#	request-ixfr yes;
#	transfer-format one-answer | many-answers;
#	keys "key-1"; "key-2"; THE KEYS REFERRED ARE USED TO SIGN TSIG TRANSACTIONS FOR
#			THE SPECIFIED SERVER (ZONE TRANSFER AND DDNS UPDATES)
# 			SYNTAX ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE KEYS TO BE DEFINED BUT BIND 9.X ONLY SUPPORTS ONE
#	transfers 10; LIMITS THE NUMBER OF CONCURRENT ZONE TRANSFERS FROM ANY GIVEN SERVER
# }

#=====================================================================================#

# LOGGING CHANNEL ASSOCIATES OUTPUT METHODS, FORMAT AND SEVERITY WITH
# A LABEL THAT CAN BE USED LATER WITH THE CATEGORY
# THE SEVERITIES CAN BE ONE OF THE DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR AND CRITICAL
# BUT FOR DEBUG WE CAN ALSO SPECIFY A LEVEL TO LIMIT THE DEBUG MESSAGES LOGGED 
# TO ALL MESSAGES WITH LOWER LEVEL THAN THE ONE SPECIFIED
# THE FACILITY FOR SYSLOG CAN BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
# kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp, cron, authpriv, ftp, local0 - local7
# IF INSTEAD OF DEBUG WE SPECIFY DYNAMIC, THE SERVER GLOBAL DEBUG LEVEL WILL
# BE USED.
# DEBUGGING MESSAGES CAN BE ACTIVATED BY STARTING THE SERVER WITH -d
# OR BY USING RNDC TRACE / RNDC NOTRACE
